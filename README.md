# React Signup Page Assignment:
A simple 2 column signup/landing page using react and a grid/css library of your choice.  
The form itself doesn't actually have to post to a live backend - I'm just interested in the frontend code.

1). Create a react app using https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
2). Add in a Grid/CSS framework of your choosing. I'd recommend https://react-bootstrap.github.io/ OR https://material.io/ OR https://bulma.io/ (but if you've got other ideas or want to roll your own that's fine too).
3). The first column should have some basic html some content(lorem ipsum is fine) - a heading, a paragraph, and a placeholder image.
4). The second column should have a signup form asking for name, email address, and zip code.  The form should validate on the frontend. https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik & https://github.com/jquense/yup
5). If you use a css/grid library and its components for things like the submit button and form inputs or if you roll your own - I'd like to see some custom css on those elements.  Color updates/kerning/ hover color changes etc etc.. totally up to you.
